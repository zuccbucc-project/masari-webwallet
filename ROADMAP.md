- stop sync
- improve tx fee calculation
- send "all my zucc" button

- wallet translation in multiple languages (will include date and number format)
- wasm to improve speed
- receive page: add payment id support
- receive page: add mempool check (only when payment id) & progression
- offline payment made easier
- p2p connection between a computer and another device(phone, ...) for a sync method (to reduce the heat on small devices)

- detect when multiple tabs are open to prevent data collision
- continue to scan while the page is not focused
- support https://github.com/monero-project/monero/wiki/URI-Formatting
